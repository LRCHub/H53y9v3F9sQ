All these scars you keep inside
Said they'd heal but oh, they lied
Just take a look at the world outside
It's much too late for you and I

Build your fences, go build your walls
Build 'em up high so no one sees you fall
Just take a look at the other side
Who said that you could take these lives

Keep them out, keep them out
Heavy lies the paper crown
Keep them out, keep them out
The only way from here is down

All these promises and guarantees
Ain't no evidence, no magic key
Do you think that we're just gonna sit tight
Hope and pray that everything is done right
Gonna take a lot more to get it through
Only one we need saving from is you

Keep them out, keep them out
Heavy lies the paper crown
Keep them out, keep them out
The only way from here is down

I see him there, bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top in each hand, like an old stone savage armed
He moves in darkness as it seems to me, not of woods only and the shade of trees
He will not go behind his father's saying, and he likes having thought of it so well, he says again, 'good fences make good neighbors'

Keep them out, keep them out
Heavy lies the paper crown
Keep them out, keep them out
The only way from here is down

Tear it down, tear it down
Go rip up your paper crown
Tear it down, tear it down
We're buried six feet underground
