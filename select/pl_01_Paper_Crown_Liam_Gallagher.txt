When they gave you roses
And believed your wild excuses you were
Sealing the deal
(Halfway down the road and ain't it funny how
The ghosts they fade and suddenly appear
You went too far
Oh woman now you're feeling the fear
Cause you've never been alone before
And the wolf is at the door
Now it's better if you hold your breath
and don't look down
At the pages of your paper crown
You reached out for more
and as the waves hit at the shore you felt
The fading of your will
Choke back the matter from the bottom
of the ladder ask me
If I love you still
You went too far
Oh woman now you're feeling the fear
Cause you've never been alone before
And the wolf is at the door
And the hounds of hell they won't lie down
On the ashes of your paper crown
In the bright light of the sun
Well you make sure everyone
Could see your face
You made fun of everyone who falls
But meantime they were saving you a place
Cause you've never been alone before
And the wolf is at the door
And the talking heads don't make a sound
At the ageing of your paper crown
Better if you don't look down
At the pages of your paper crown
