I want to be the key that locks a suitcase packed
Never to come back from a faraway town
I want to be the jewel in a paper crown
So tell the city councilman and birthday clown

Oh if you get beyond it you will never come back
Like a penny placed on a railroad track
You can hit real hard, it will hit right back
You have to really mean it just to leave a scratch

I know your heart is filled with fire
You're burning out
I know we're lost
So are the stars in space

I want to be the clue that was right under your nose
Like a funny rose that you cannot smell
I want to be the secret you can't help but tell
Oh let me be a penny in the wishing well

I want to be the hand that tells the minute not the hour
Take as many turns around as I can get
I want to serve the supper at a table set
With crystal and with silver they will never forget

I know your heart is filled with fire
You're burning out
I know I'll find what I wished for that night

I want a love I can make with scraps on the floor
Watch as I make one better than before
When I am high, when I am low
I'm sure to find love wherever I go

I want a love I can make with scraps on the floor
Watch as I make one better than before
When I am high, when I am low
I'm sure to find love wherever I go
I'm sure to find love wherever I go
I'm sure to find love wherever I go
