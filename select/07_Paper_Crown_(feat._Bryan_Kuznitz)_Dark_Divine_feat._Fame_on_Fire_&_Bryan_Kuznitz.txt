Paper
Paper crown
Is torn apart because we're
Breaking
Breaking
Down

Burn me to the ground

All is lost but not forgiven
Always bent but not yet broken

I'm so sick
Of all this
Uncovering new lies
I'm getting sick of trusting
When there's nothing left inside

You know your paper, paper crown
Is torn apart because we're
Breaking, breaking down
We're not invincible
You're not untouchable
Perfectly capable of
Starting the fire so
Burn it burn it burn it down

Burn me to the ground

Deny
Deny
Turn away and close your eyes
You think what you did was fine

I can't kill what's already dead to me

How can you not see
All of your hypocrisy

You know your paper, paper crown
Is torn apart because we're
Breaking, breaking down
We're not invincible
You're not untouchable
Perfectly capable of
Starting the fire so
Burn it burn it burn it down

You know your paper, paper crown
Is torn apart because we're
Breaking, breaking down
We're not invincible
You're not untouchable
Perfectly capable of
Starting the fire so
Burn it burn it burn it down

I'm not
So pure
You just can't see my demon
I'm broke
I'm torn
From everything you did

You know your paper, paper crown
Is torn apart because we're
Breaking, breaking down

We're not invincible

You're not untouchable
Perfectly capable of
Starting the fire so
Burn it burn it burn it down

You know your paper, paper crown
Is torn apart because we're
Breaking, breaking down
We're not invincible
You're not untouchable
Perfectly capable of
Starting the fire so
Burn me to the ground

Burn it to the ground
