Come on, babe, so what'cha gonna do?
Tell your momma, you're gonna ride it on through
You walk on splinters, be sleepin' on nails
Come and let your hair down, runnin' over the rails
Get up, babe
Bring it down
Let me see your paper crown
Get up, babe
Bring it down
Let me see your paper crown
I wanna see your paper crown
Then let me see you shake your body to the ground
I'll be your king with paper crown
Oh, let me see you shake your body to the ground
(Look out)
Save yourself, you're walking through the room
Shadow boxing, come and see my girl
She's a rainbow, never need to smile
Like throwin' candy on a funeral fire
Come on
Get up, babe
Bring it down
Let me see your paper crown
Get up, babe
Bring it down
Let me see your paper crown
I'll be your king, your paper crown
Then let me see you shake your body to the ground
I'll be your king with the paper crown
Then let me see you shake your body to the ground
Yessir
With this paper, I go dumb, froze both arms
Might got frostbite, 'cause my neck feel numb
Pointers 'round my neck, she say I gotta lot of charm
Type of money make a bougie broad wanna feel my pawn
Thick and it's warm, like grits in the morn'
Got two things in common, that's my bitch and my foreign
Everything exotic, we got chronic so the vibe's right
Got that type of ass that can really give the blind sight
If you wanna see (Wanna see it, wanna see)
This paper crown (You wanna see it, wanna see)
I need you to see you (Yeah, let me see it)
Shake your body to the ground (Let me see it, let me see it, let me see)
(Ayy) If you wanna see (Yeah, you wanna see it, you wanna see it)
My paper crown (Ay, you wanna see it, you wanna see it)
I need to see you (Let me see it, let me see it)
Shake your body to the ground
Your momma should be proud how you entertain the crowd
But, if you look at me too long, you might be with child
Ay, I might buy the Birkin if she worth the bag (Yes)
Mix it with the hash, take a puff and pass (Yes)
Go and bounce that ass, go and bounce that ass (Mhm)
Loan paper cash is through that nigga's stash (Mhm)
Strong tank of gas, flame this up, get blasted
She treat Meek like me, she 'bout to blow me fast (Mhm)
Yeah, you wanna see it, you wanna see it
Yeah, let me see it
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it
Ay, yeah
If you wanna see (Wanna see it, wanna see)
This paper crown (You wanna see it, wanna see)
I need you to see you (Yeah, let me see it)
Shake your body to the ground (Let me see it, let me see it, let me see)
(Ay) If you wanna see (Yeah, you wanna see it, you wanna see it)
My paper crown (Ay, you wanna see it, you wanna see it)
I need to see you (Let me see it, let me see it)
Shake your body to the ground
